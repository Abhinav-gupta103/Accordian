# Accordian Description

This project is a simple implementation of an accordion component in React. The accordion component allows users to toggle the display of content sections, making it a useful tool for organizing and presenting information in a collapsible format.

# Features
items are data of data.json.
The items having items array as non-empty should be clickable and show a list of the sub-items from the array.
The items having items array as empty should not be clickable and should have no dropdown symbol.
Use the cursor pointer to display the description.
Only one accordion should be open at one time, if other one is open then the previous one should be closed automatically.
